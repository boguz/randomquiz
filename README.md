# RANDOM QUIZ

Just a simple Javascript quiz game.
The goal was for me to learn a little bit more Javascript and have some fun.

### Things to do
- **Refactor!!!   =D**
- Add starting screen to choose dificulty, number of questions and maybe theme
- Add info button on bottom (with link to OPTD, github repo,...)
- When user clicks a wrong answer, we should the show the correct one.
